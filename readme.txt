Popularity prediction of GitHub repositories based on static software metrics by using Extreme Learning Machine

A dataset construction tool is introduced that automatically retrieve data from the GitHub API and SourceMonitor CLI considering different project topics sought after, recently. 
Accordingly, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method is applied in order to exhibit the potential association between static software metrics and GitHub star count. 
The prediction performance of ELM model is investigated on different datasets generated with respect to three evaluation criteria including MAE, MSE and R2.

For this purpose, seven different data sets were created for the first time. The data sets created;
